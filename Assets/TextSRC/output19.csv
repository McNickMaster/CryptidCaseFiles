0,Doctor Lash,"""Ah… Detective, hello"""
1,You,"""Hello Dr. Lash, what’re you doing here?"""
11,Doctor Lash,"""I worked with Dr. MacGrain, and was the last one to see him alive it seems…"""
111,You,"""Ah. Did you notice anything– off?"""
1111,Doctor Lash,"""Tiernan was a difficult man to read typically."""
11111,Doctor Lash,"""Earlier though, he definitely seemed– manic, I might say."""
111111,You,"""What do you mean?"""
1111111,Doctor Lash,"""Weirdly excited, he had a large bag with him, and he briefly mentioned he was finally dealing with something."""
11111111,You,"""Did he say anything else?"""
111111111,Doctor Lash,"""Just that he should’ve done this a while ago I believe… that’s all"""
1111111111,You,"""Thanks for your help.""[end]"
1111111112,You,"""Well… sorry for your loss.""[end]"
11111112,You,"""Where was he heading?"""
111111121,Doctor Lash,"""To where he is now. I had just left, so he picked the perfect time when he’d be alone."""
1111111211,You,"""I see…""[end]"
112,You,"""What was he doing when you saw him?"""
1121,Doctor Lash,"""We passed each other in the hallway, he had this large bag with him."""
11211,Doctor Lash,"""I inquired about it, and while he didn’t exactly answer, he did say he was fixing something."""
112111,You,"""Where was he headed?"""
1121111,Doctor Lash,"""Well, right where you’ve found him. I was just leaving to take my break."""
11211111,Doctor Lash,"""He chose the exact time he knew no one would be in the room."""
112111111,You,"""Did he elaborate on what he was fixing?"""
1121111111,Doctor Lash,"""Afraid not. I didn’t ask, figuring he’d made some mistake in his work and was correcting it."""
11211111111,You,"""Very well, that’s all""[end]"
112112,You,"""He did say what he was fixing?"""
1121121,Doctor Lash,"""Not exactly, he just said it had been a problem for a while."""
11211211,Doctor Lash,"""I must say, ashamedly, that I did not inquire further, it was– and still is, incredibly late."""
112112111,You,"""It is, you best get some rest, I’ll take it from here.""[end]"
112112112,You,"""Ah well, that’s all then.""[end]"
2,You,"""Hello Doctor… was the victim one of your coworkers?"""
21,Doctor Lash,"""He was, and I talked to him not too long before he was killed."""
211,You,"""Did he say anything suspicious?"""
2111,Doctor Lash,"""It wasn’t a long conversation, but he said something about trying to fix something that had been bothering him for a while."""
21111,Doctor Lash,"""He said that he couldn’t ignore it any longer."""
211111,Doctor Lash,"""I didn’t inquire further since I am… especially tired."""
2111111,You,"""Has he talked about this problem before?"""
21111111,Doctor Lash,"""I’m not entirely sure. He has talked briefly about things troubling him at home, misfortune, that sort of thing."""
211111111,Doctor Lash,"""But more recently he’s been a bit more bedraggled, and while he didn’t say anything, I think whatever he’s been dealing with got worse recently."""
2111111111,You,"""Is Dr. MacGrain married?"""
21111111111,Doctor Lash,"""Huh?"""
211111111111,Doctor Lash,"""Oh, no. He lives alone."""
2111111111111,You,"""That’s all then.""[end]"
2111111112,You,"""Interesting, thanks for your help.""[end]"
2111112,You,"""Had he been acting strangely earlier in the day?"""
21111121,Doctor Lash,"""I’m pretty sure his lunch break consisted of him driving downtown, and when he came back he had that bag he brought in with him."""
211111211,Doctor Lash,"""Didn’t think much of it at the time."""
2111112111,You,"""I see, that’s all then.""[end]"
212,You,"""Were you the last one to see him?"""
2121,Doctor Lash,"""I was, I was exiting the mortuary to take my break and ran into him. He was looking a little manic and he had this large bag with him."""
21211,Doctor Lash,"""He picked the exact time he knew no one would be in the mortuary…"""
212111,You,"""Do you know what he had in the bag?"""
2121111,Doctor Lash,"""Not a clue, I do know that he didn’t come in with it, but got it in the middle of the day during his lunch break."""
21211111,You,"""Did he say where he went?"""
212111111,Doctor Lash,"""Someplace downtown, he didn’t mention anywhere by name.""[end]"
21211112,You,"""Thanks, that’s everything.""[end]"
212112,You,"""Was he acting strangely earlier in the day?"""
2121121,Doctor Lash,"""When he came back from his lunch break I noticed he had trouble focusing."""
21211211,Doctor Lash,"""I chalked it up to whatever he’s been going through."""
212112111,You,"""What’s he been going through?"""
2121121111,Doctor Lash,"""I couldn’t say exactly, just seems like he can’t catch a break lately. He’s been a bit of a mess."""
21211211111,You,"""Interesting…""[end]"
213,You,"""...will you still be performing the autopsy?"""
2131,Doctor Lash,"""..."""
21311,Doctor Lash,"""I don’t think I can bring myself too…"""
213111,Doctor Lash,"""Eudora wasn’t as close, she’ll– she’ll do a good job."""
2131111,You,"""Were you and Dr. MacGrain close?"""
21311111,Doctor Lash,"""We weren’t like– best pals or anything, but we talked fairly regularly."""
213111111,Doctor Lash,"""Tiernan wasn’t especially talkative, but I never minded."""
2131111111,You,"""Did anything odd stick out to you about today?"""
21311111111,Doctor Lash,"""Not until his lunch break. He apparently left and drove somewhere downtown."""
213111111111,Doctor Lash,"""I’m not sure where, but when he returned he brought this big bag of stuff."""
2131111111111,Doctor Lash,"""I didn’t think much of it at the time, but then when I ran into him just before he died, he was very manic."""
21311111111111,Doctor Lash,"""Muttering about… ‘fixing’ something."""
213111111111111,You,"""All very helpful…""[end]"
2131111112,You,"""Any idea why he might do this?"""
21311111121,Doctor Lash,"""He’s never been a very– lucky or cheerful fellow. Many doctors aren't, I'm afraid."""
213111111211,Doctor Lash,"""But ever since he’s started working in this morgue as a pathologist’s assistant, he’s had terrible luck."""
2131111112111,Doctor Lash,"""Perhaps he tried to fix it with some– oh I don’t know, occult means?"""
21311111121111,You,"""Interesting…""[end]"
2131112,You,"""Do you have any insights into what Dr. MacGrain might’ve been thinking?"""
21311121,Doctor Lash,"""Thinking back on everything now, Tiernan’s never been a very… fortunate person."""
213111211,Doctor Lash,"""Ever since he started working here as a pathologist’s assistant it’s like he’s been cursed."""
2131112111,Doctor Lash,"""Perhaps, especially with the uptick in strange supernatural stuff happening recently, he tried to fix his luck."""
21311121111,You,"""Things have been picking up recently, haven’t they?"""
213111211111,Doctor Lash,"""Yes they most certainly have. Never before this year have I had to conduct so many cryptid-related autopsies…""[end]"
21311121112,You,"""Thank you for your help.""[end]"
