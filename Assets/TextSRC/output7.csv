11,Eloise DeTour,"""Oh! Do- do you know where he is?"""
111,You,"""Afraid not, I just have some questions."""
1111,You,"""When did you last see Evan?"""
11111,Eloise DeTour,"""April 9th, he didn't say where he was going."""
111111,Eloise DeTour,"""I guess I didn't ask him, but oh how I wish I did. I tried calling him when it got late and nothing, so I called the police.""[back111]"
1112,You,"""What does Evan do for work?"""
11121,Eloise DeTour,"""He works at some dock in Abra City, I couldn't tell you why. He was always more of a fan of the mountains. He doesn't even like the water.""[back111]"
1113,You,"""Does Evan own a brown fishing jacket?"""
11131,Eloise DeTour,"""Fishing jacket? I doubt it, he hated anything to do with the water.""[back111]"
1114,You,"""Does Evan or someone close to him own a boat?"""

1131111,Eloise DeTour,"""A fishing boat? Evan didn't fish!"""
11311111,You,"""Would Evan have gone out with a friend?"""
113111111,Eloise DeTour,"""Evan hates being on the sea! This doesn't make any sense."""
1131111111,Eloise DeTour,"""I can't- this can't be true."" click[end]"
11311112,You,"""He could've been going to Pettiget Island."""
113111121,Eloise DeTour,"""For what reason? We don't know anyone there, he hated sailing."""
1131111211,Eloise DeTour,"""Who even are you, I'm calling the police."" click[end]"

2112,You,"""What did Evan do for work, for fun?"""
21121,Eloise DeTour,"""For work? He worked at the docks in Abra, which he absolutely hated.""[back211]"
2113,You,"""Did Evan own a brown fishing jacket?"""
21131,Eloise DeTour,"""You sure it wasn't some sort of survival gear? That'd be more like him.""[back211]"

212,You,"""Possibly, can you tell me about Evan?"""

21211,Eloise DeTour,"""What else do you want to know?"""
212111,You,"""Why'd he hate his work?"""
2121111,Eloise DeTour,"""He hates the water, really, always hated boats. I think he only works at the dock cause- well- it's all he could get.""[back21211]"
212112,You,"""When did you last see him?"""
2121121,Eloise DeTour,"""April 9th, he left that morning, when he didn't come home I called his friends and they didn't know where he was either, and that's when I called the police.""[back21211]"
212113,You,"""Did he own a brown fishing jacket?"""
2121131,Eloise DeTour,"""You sure it wasn't some survival gear? Cause he didn't fish.""[back21211]"

213122,You,"""Does he have a boat?"""
2131221,Eloise DeTour,"""God no, what a waste of money. I'd be baffled if he got one."""
21312211,Eloise DeTour,"""And confused as to how he afforded it.""[back21312]"
213123,You,"""That's all, thanks for your time.""[end]"
