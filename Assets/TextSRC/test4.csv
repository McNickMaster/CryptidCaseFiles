211,You,â€œDo you recognize anything here?â€

3121,Eric Meng,"â€œThose footprints do, they start and stop without warning, and they definitely donâ€™t look humanâ€"

@0,Officer Jameson,â€œGood evening Detective.â€
1,You,"â€œYou were the first officer on scene, correct?â€"
11,Officer Jameson,â€œThatâ€™s correct.â€
111,You,â€œWho called it in?â€
1111,Officer Jameson,"â€œSome local saw it first, called it in but didnâ€™t stick aroundâ€[back11]"

1131,Officer Jameson,â€œAround 1:30 I wanna say?â€[back11]
114,You,"â€œThatâ€™s all for now, thanksâ€[end]"
115,You,[locked] â€œHe was still alive?â€
1151,Officer Jameson,"â€œYep, when I arrived it looked like he was frozen to his seat. I snapped him out of it I think, but then he just started spouting nonsenseâ€"
11511,Officer Jameson,"â€œI removed him from the truck, and he wasnâ€™t even bleeding that badly, but then next thing you know he collapses into me, dead.â€[back11]"
2,You,"â€œâ€˜Goodâ€™ is debatable, given the circumstancesâ€"
21,Officer Jameson,â€œIâ€™m doing fine.â€
211,You,"â€œNot the point, listen, can you answer some questions?â€"
2111,Officer Jameson,â€œIf I gottaâ€[back2131]

21312,You,â€œWhatâ€™d you see when you got here?â€
213121,Officer Jameson,"â€œAll this, just darker. Oh, and the driver was alive I suppose.â€[back2131][unlock21315]"
21313,You,â€œWhen did you get here?â€
213131,Officer Jameson,â€œSometime around 1:30â€[back2131]
21314,You,"â€œThatâ€™s all for now, thanksâ€[end]"
21315,You,[locked] â€œYou said he was still alive?â€

3,You,â€œI have some questionsâ€
31,Officer Jameson,â€œShoot.â€
311,You,"â€œYou were the first one here, right?â€"
3111,Officer Jameson,"â€œYep. Some local called in a crash, I got here right before the ambulance, tried helping the driver out of the truck.â€[back31][unlock 315]"
312,You,â€œWhen did this happen?â€
3121,Officer Jameson,"â€œOh I dunno, I got here around 1:30. The crash couldnâ€™t have happened too much earlier than that"" [back31]"
313,You,â€œPut anything together yourself?â€
3131,Officer Jameson,"â€œIâ€™ve put together that some idiot lost control of his vehicle and crashed it, killing himself in the process. Whyâ€™re you here again?â€[back31][unlock316]"
314,You,â€œI think thatâ€™s everythingâ€[end]
315,You,[locked] â€œWhat condition was the driver in?â€
3151,Officer Jameson,"â€œHe was still alive, at first he wasnâ€™t responsive at all, but I think I snapped him out of it when I tried moving him, and he lost it.â€"
31511,You,â€œWhat do you mean he â€˜lost itâ€™?â€
315111,Officer Jameson,"â€œLike, rambling and sputtering, all nonsense, but he mustâ€™ve tired himself out cause after a bit he collapsed.â€[back31]"
31512,You,â€œHow hurt was he?â€
315121,Officer Jameson,"â€œHe didnâ€™t look too bad to be honest. Iâ€™ve seen more people survive worse, sure he was bleeding, but nowhere important. But then, after a minute, the poor dude just collapsed into me.â€[back31]"
31513,You,â€œCrash mustâ€™ve rattled him badlyâ€[back31]
316,You,[locked] â€œIâ€™m here cause itâ€™s not as simple as thatâ€

@0,Eric Meng,"â€œGood afternoon, Detectiveâ€"
1,You,â€œWhatâ€™s up?â€
11,Eric Meng,"â€œJust doinâ€™ my job, you just come by to chat?â€"
111,You,"""Yep, not too worried about this caseâ€"
1111,Eric Meng,"â€œThatâ€™s either a great sign, or a terrible oneâ€[end]"
112,You,"â€œNah, just got some questions for youâ€"
1121,Eric Meng,â€œI see.â€
11211,You,â€œWhat do you make of this?â€
112111,Eric Meng,"â€œI dunno, looks like some washed up wreck, definitely got attacked out there, but who knows whyâ€[back1121]"
11212,You,â€œThis doesnâ€™t happen often does it?â€
112121,Eric Meng,"â€œNo it does not, and good thing too, given a lot of ours dependence on the waterâ€[back1121][unlock11215]"
11213,You,â€œDo you know anything about this victim?â€
112131,Eric Meng,"â€œAll I see is a hand, so I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™d recognize them.â€[back1121][unlock11216]"
11214,You,â€œI think thatâ€™s everythingâ€[end]
11215,You,[locked] â€œWhy isnâ€™t this more common?â€
112151,Eric Meng,"â€œMost creatures in the sea arenâ€™t that aggressive, especially towards big ships with barely any meat on them. This couldnâ€™t have been a random attack.â€[back1121]"
11216,You,"[locked] â€œMustâ€™ve been a fisher though, right?â€"
112161,Eric Meng,"â€œThis is a fishing ship, but I donâ€™t see the typical equipment. Plenty of fishermen have odd jobs around here, maybe they were on an errand.â€[back1121]"
2,You,"â€œGood afternoon, just got a few questions.â€"
21,Eric Meng,"â€œSure thing, ask awayâ€"
211,You,â€œNotice anything off?â€
2111,Eric Meng,â€œThe only thing off is this whole ordeal.â€
21111,Eric Meng,"â€œThese sorts of attacks almost never happen, Abraâ€™s sea creatures donâ€™t bother us lest we bother them.â€[back21][unlock215]"
212,You,â€œKnow anything about the victim?â€
2121,Eric Meng,"â€œItâ€™s just a hand, soâ€“ no. The most I can surmise is they were a fisher.â€[back21]"
213,You,â€œKnow anything about the ship?â€
2131,Eric Meng,"â€œSeems like a standard gillnetter, fishing ship, though they couldâ€™ve been using it for anything. A lot of sailors in Oldport have side-gigs.â€[back21]"
214,You,"â€œThanks for your help, thatâ€™s allâ€[end]"
215,You,[locked] â€œWhat could the victim have done to provoke something?â€
2151,Eric Meng,"â€œBesides attacking them? I got no clue, unless the captain was a fool, they wouldâ€™ve known not to harass anything.â€[back21]"
3,You,â€œYou got a minute?â€
31,Eric Meng,"â€œJust one, why?â€"
311,You,â€œIâ€™ll make it quick thenâ€
3111,Eric Meng,â€œBetter get to your pointâ€[back31]
312,You,â€œWhatâ€™ve you put together so far?â€
3121,Eric Meng,"â€œNot much, the ship was obviously attacked, but by what? Oldportâ€™s sailors know better than to provoke any sea creatures.â€[back31][unlock316]"
313,You,â€œHave you seen this happen before?â€
3131,Eric Meng,"â€œA wreck like this? Almost never happens, good thing too, given the townâ€™s dependence on the water.â€[back31]"
314,You,â€œKnow anything about the ship or crew?â€
3141,Eric Meng,"â€œTypical gillnetter like this would just have one or two people manning it, given that thereâ€™s just the one hand and no other signs, Iâ€™m assuming just one sailor.â€[back31][unlock317]"
315,You,"â€œMy minuteâ€™s up, thatâ€™s everything.â€[end]"
316,You,[locked] â€œWhat would provoke something?â€
3161,Eric Meng,"â€œOh I dunno, attacking it I guess? Staying too long in its territory maybe?â€[back31]"
317,You,"[locked] â€œGillnetter, that a fishing vessel?â€"
3171,Eric Meng,"â€œMost often, though so many sailors around here have odd jobs, who knows what they were up toâ€[back31]"

112,You,â€œDo you recognize the ship?â€
1121,Old Sailor,"â€œYessir, thatâ€™s a gillnetter. Fishing ship, decent enough to get you as far as Pettiget by the looks of it.â€[back11]"
113,You,â€œKnow what couldâ€™ve done this?â€
1131,Old Sailor,"â€œAh hell, no clue. Weâ€™ve got a lot of sea beasties in this lake, but us sailors know how to avoid them and they know to avoid us, so I dunno what changed here.â€[back11]"

115,You,"[locked] ""Do a lot of people here have odd jobs?â€"

211,You,â€œCan you tell me what kind of ship that is?â€
2111,Fred Fiegel,"â€œThat thereâ€™s a gillnetter, fishinâ€™ ship mostly, though some just use â€˜em to sail around, maybe back and forth between Pettiget.â€[back21]"
212,You,â€œDo you recognize that ship?â€
2121,Fred Fiegel,"â€œThe specific one? Nah, canâ€™t say I do. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ve probably seen it around here before, but my memoryâ€™s not what it used to be.â€[back21]"
213,You,â€œDo you know the area well?â€
2131,Fred Fiegel,â€œLike the back of my hand!â€[back21][unlock215][unlock216]

215,You,[locked] â€œWhat can you tell me about the route to Pettiget from here?â€
2151,Fred Fiegel,"â€œThe waterâ€™s not too treacherous on its own, but the visibility is often pretty shit. Were someone to sail on their own theyâ€™d need to be fairly experienced.â€[back21]"
216,You,[locked] â€œWhat can you tell me about the creatures that live in the lake?â€
2161,Fred Fiegel,"â€œOh thereâ€™s plenty, a few make their homes around Pettiget, nests and whatnot. Though weâ€™ve got all those spots marked so we know to avoid â€˜em.â€[back21]"

31,Old Sailor,"â€œOh sure thing, dâ€™ya need me for something?â€"
311,You,"""Just need you to answer some questions.â€"
3111,You,â€œWhat couldâ€™ve done this to a ship?â€
31111,Old Sailor,"â€œOh thereâ€™s plenty that couldâ€™ve, but I dunno many that wouldâ€™ve. No real reason for our beasties to attack us, weâ€™re hardly worth the trouble to eat.â€[back311]"
3112,You,â€œWhat was this ship doing out there?â€
31121,Old Sailor,"â€œCoulda been just out fishing, but I donâ€™t see any big nets prepared. They might have been doinâ€™ some errands, lotta sailors get hired to transport things to and from Pettiget.â€[back311]"
3113,You,â€œWhere would this ship have been sailing?â€
31131,Old Sailor,"â€œEither sittinâ€™ out in the open water, or to Pettiget Island.â€"
311311,Old Sailor,â€œThe trip across the lake ainâ€™t really viable.â€[back311]

31211,You,â€œJust tell me if you know anything usefulâ€
312111,Old Sailor,"â€œAh heck, I dunno what youâ€™d think is useful. Thatâ€™s a gillnetter there, doesnâ€™t go far, so I dunno what couldâ€™ve wrecked it. Nothinâ€™ between here and Pettiget ever really attacks us sailorsâ€[back3121][unlock31214]"

2111,Amelia Watson,"â€œOn the boat? Not bad, I mean, it managed to still drift back to shore. Whatever attacked it didnâ€™t intend to sink it, I donâ€™t think. The marks look like it was getting at something onboard.â€[back21]"
