"A dark night, just my luck I get this case."
"Looking at this scene now, this will be where I collect most of the important information"
I can interact with certain things here to hear what they have to tell me.
If I click on the evidence markers (with my mind) then I should learn a detail about the case.
If I talk with the other people here (by clicking on them) then I can talk with them as well.
I have a hunch all the information here is important in some way to help solve the case.
"Certain things I notice I'll have to take a picture of, that important info will be a polaroid in my office."
"Once I've scoured the scene for clues, I should head back to my office..."
(By pressing the M button with my mind)
