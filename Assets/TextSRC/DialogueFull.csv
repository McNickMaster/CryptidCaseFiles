12211,Edwin ,"""The reports are only ever increasing in frequency since that blasted reward was announcd a few months back. All of them having little consistency with one another."""
122111,Edwin ,"""With the closest being that there have been several people that have claimed that The Beast looked to be some kind of feral deer standing on its hind legs."" "
1221111,Edwin ,"""While a few others have claimed to see what they have described to be a very large bear with mangy fur and dried blood on it's pelt."" "
12211111,Edwin ,"""I believe that there were even one or two people that claimed that they saw something akin to a fox or coyote that looks completly feral."""
122111111,Edwin ,"""As for me I think that it's some kind of creature beyound our comprehension. A spirit of the forest given physical form, attacking those that disrespect it.""[back1111]"
123,You ,"""Were you there the night that The Beast attacked."""
1231,Edwin ,"""I was....it was supposeted to be the happiest night of my life. As it was where I got to truly see The Beast in all its glory."" "
12311,Edwin ,"""A beautiful thing that towered among the trees, bigger than anything animal I have ever seen."" "
123111,Edwin ,"""Though I will admit that it looked more like a walking corpse than it did a majestic creature of legend."" "
1231111,Edwin ,"""I swear that I could almost see the skeleton of the creature pushing through it's skin in some areas."""
12311111,Edwin ,"""But then that beatiful moment was shattered by shoutting coming from one of the nearby campsites."""
123111111,Edwin ,"""At first I though nothing of it, but then The Beast began bounding twards the source of the noise."""
1231111111,Edwin ,"""Their shouts quickly being replaced of that of blood curtling screams.""[back1111]"
124,You,"""Has anyone else been attacked recently?"""
1241,Edwin ,"""There are usually always a few different atttacks from what people claim to be The Beast, though they usually tend to only have scrapes a bruises."" "
12411,Edwin ,"""But there was said to be someone that had stumbled into one of the campsites with large gash marks on his body."" "
124111,Edwin ,"""Unfortuantly he died before they got him to the hosipital."" "
1241111,Edwin ,"""There may be other incidents but that is the only one I know of.""[end]"
2,You ,"""Look pal I don't have time for all this conspiratory nonsence."""
21,Edwin ,"""You don't scare me cop, I've been through hell and back in 86'. Nothing you can say will ever get under my skin, now what is it you want anyways."""
211,You ,"""I'm calling to ask about some big monster."""

21111,Edwin ,"""Said to attack those that cause a disturbance in the forest that it roams."""
211111,You ,"""Yes, that is the one, is there anything you can tell me?"""
2111111,Edwin ,"""I know just about everything there's to know about it. Some would even call me an expert in the subject matter. Now what is it you would like to know?""[back1111]"
21112,You ,"""Maybe.....I don't know and I honestly don't care, I just need any information that you may have on the case. Then we can both go on with our lives."""
211121,Edwin ,"""Young folk, always so rude and pushy to get answers. Never did respect your elders enough, did you boy? For that you'll get nothing from me."" "
