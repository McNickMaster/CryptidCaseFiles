11,Officer Jeb ,"""Detective, as I was heading to the location discovered within the basement of Bert's business, I had witnessed a blinding light fill the sky. """
111,Officer Jeb ,"""Followed shortly after by a lound explosion. The smoke from the aftermath being what led me to the clearing and the very gruesome site that is before us."" "
1111,You ,"""Were there any witnesses?"""
11111,Officer Jeb ,"""None, the only reason that we found out about it was due to the information uncovered at Bert's business."" "
111111,Officer Jeb ,"""Aside from that I don't think anyone was supposted to know about this place.""[back11]"
112,You ,"""Any idea who these people might be?"""
1121,Officer Jeb ,"""I honestly don't have even the slightest idea, my guess is that it's just a group of weirdos that got in way over their heads.""[back11]"

11211111,You ,"""It's almost as if they're apart of something bigger."""
112111111,Officer Jeb ,"""Dont be rediculous Detective, these were simply some kids that were playing dress up."""
1121111111,Officer Jeb ,"""Clearly they got their hands on something that they really didn't understand, ultimately paying the price with their life."" "
11211111111,Officer Jeb ,The Officer seems to look slightly uneasy at the shift in the conversation.

11411,You,"""I never told anyone about that, not even the Officer that was dispatched to the location."""
114111,Officer Jeb ,"He seems to stiffen slightly at the statement. D-Don't be rediculous Detective, of course you told me, how else would I have been able to fill out the report."""

114111111,Officer Jeb ,"""Maybey all of this is starting to be too much for you. Making you forget and misconstrue what clearly happened and make it seem like it didin't."""

2,You ,"""What the hell happened here!"""
21,Officer Jeb ,"""I wish I could tell you, but this is what it looked like when I got here."""
211,Officer Jeb ,"""Though when I was traveling to the location there was a bright light followed shortly after by what sounded like an explosion."" "
