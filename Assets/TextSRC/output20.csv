1,You,"""When did you get here?"""
11,Amelia Watson,"""Oh only 5 or so minutes before you to be honest."""
111,Amelia Watson,"""I haven’t had time to fully survey the scene."""
1111,You,"""Taken some pictures already though?"""
11111,Amelia Watson,"""Of the writings, yes. Plus the layout of the room, I don't want to waste my film though.""[unlock1114]"
111111,Amelia Watson,"""And before you ask, I’ll send you whatever photos you need.""[getEVIDENCE_PHOTOS][back111]"
1112,You,"""What’re your first thoughts?"""
11121,Amelia Watson,"""This one’s a stumper. With nothing being seen entering or exiting the premises one might suspect suicide."""
111211,Amelia Watson,"""But why do that, then write a message in your blood?""[back111]"
1113,You,"""Well I’ll leave you to it."""
11131,Amelia Watson,"""Appreciate it, and I’ll send over some photos once they’re developed.""[getEVIDENCE_PHOTOS][end]"
1114,You,"[locked] ""These symbols, they’re strange, aren’t they?"""
11141,Amelia Watson,"""Incredibly, it’s familiar though…""[back211]"
2,You,"""What are you doing?"""
21,Amelia Watson,"""Taking pictures, which I’ll send you. Documenting all of this…""[getEVIDENCE_PHOTOS]"
211,Amelia Watson,"""What he’s written here is weirdly familiar."""
2111,You,"""I’ve seen them before as well."""
21111,Amelia Watson,"""Where have you seen this?"""
211111,You,"""A third party introduced it to me."""
2111111,Amelia Watson,"""Mildly concerning Detective…""[back211]"
211112,You,"""Some other case."""
2111121,Amelia Watson,"""Strange, they keep popping up in these types of cases, y’know, the weird ones.""[back211]"
2111131,You,"""I can’t recall exactly…"""
2111131,Amelia Watson,"""Weird…""[back211]"
2112,You,"""Where have you seen these symbols?"""
21121,Amelia Watson,"""At another crime scene Detective Mortsen was working on."""
21122,Amelia Watson,"""He dismissed it as gibberish, I still took some photos though."""
211221,You,"""Mind sending those over?"""
2112211,Amelia Watson,"""You got it.""[getEVIDENCE_PHOTOS][back211]"
211222,You,"""Mortsen would dismiss a smoking gun."""
2112221,Amelia Watson,"""I bet he would.""[back211]"
2113,You,"""They look like gibberish to me."""
21131,Amelia Watson,"""You and Mortsen agree then."""
211311,Amelia Watson,"""I think there’s gotta be more to it.""[back211]"
2114,You,"""What do you make of the rest of the scene?""[lock3114][back311]"
2115,You,"""Well, thanks for your insight.""[end]"
3,You,"""What do you make of all this?"""
31,Amelia Watson,"""Hard to tell, with the quick response and monitoring of most of the hospital–"""
311,Amelia Watson,"""I have no clue how something or someone could’ve gotten in here without being seen."""
3111,You,"""Is there security footage from inside the room?"""
31111,Amelia Watson,"""Nada, there is a camera that covers this hallway, but security didn’t see anything enter before or after Dr. MacGrain.""[back311]"
3112,You,"""Any chance the culprit was invisible?"""
31121,Amelia Watson,"""Maybe? But there’s so many doors and people in here."""
311211,Amelia Watson,"""Someone would’ve seen them push open a door at least, right?""[back311]"
3113,You,"""Any chance the culprit could teleport?"""
31131,Amelia Watson,"""I haven’t heard of anything like that in Abra, but if it is out there, this is going to be a nightmare.""[back311]"
3114,You,"""What do you make of what the doctor’s written there?""[lock 2114][back211]"
3115,You,"""That’s everything then.""[end]"
