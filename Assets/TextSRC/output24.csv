1111,You ,"""Were there any witnesses?"""
11111,Officer Jeb ,"""None, the only reason that we found out about it was due to the information uncovered at Bert's business."" "
111111,Officer Jeb ,"""Aside from that I don't think anyone was supposted to know about this place.""[back11]"
112,You ,"""Any idea who these people might be?"""
1121,Officer Jeb ,"""I honestly don't have even the slightest idea, my guess is that it's just a group of weirdos that got in way over their heads.""[back11]"
11211,You ,"""It feels like this is something much more than that."""
112111,Officer Jeb ,"""What do you mean Detective?"""

11211111,You ,"""It's almost as if they're apart of something bigger."""
112111111,Officer Jeb ,"""Dont be rediculous Detective, these were simply some kids that were playing dress up."""
1121111111,Officer Jeb ,"""Clearly they got their hands on something that they really didn't understand, ultimately paying the price with their life."" "

1211111121,You ,"""Your right, I guess that seems a little far fetched."""
12111111211,Officer Jeb ,He seems to visibly relax when you move away from the subject
121111112111,Officer Jeb ,"""Of course Detective, I would never steer you wrong.""[back11]"
11212,You,"""I guess your right Officer, though that doesn't take away from how strange this whole thing is.""[back11]"
113,You ,"""Anything of note at the crime scene?"""
1131,Officer Jeb ,"""No there dosen't appear to be anything of not here aside from the dead bodies and debris from the explosion."" "
11311,Officer Jeb ,"""I'm not really sure why they sent you out here, when there really isn't a case to solve here.""[back11]"
114,You,"""How did you learn about this location?"""
1141,Officer Jeb ,"""What are you talking about Detective? I was the one that investigated the location. You know that adress that you got on the back of that coded business card remember."""
11411,You,"""I never told anyone about that, not even the Officer that was dispatched to the location."""
114111,Officer Jeb ,"He seems to stiffen slightly at the statement. D-Don't be rediculous Detective, of course you told me, how else would I have been able to fill out the report."""
1141111,You ,"""There wasn't an offical case for this, it was off the books, so no report would have needed to be made."""
11411111,Officer Jeb ,"he appears to be growing slightly more uncomfortable as the conversation continues ""You sure that your doing alright."" "
114111111,Officer Jeb ,"""Maybey all of this is starting to be too much for you. Making you forget and misconstrue what clearly happened and make it seem like it didin't."""
1141111111,You ,"""No that can't be right, I know that no one should have known about that card. Which means that your not on the force....so who are you really?"
11411111111,Officer Jeb ,there are several moments of silence before the face of the Officers face drops a bit before he speaks 
114111111111,Officer Jeb ,"""You really are something else Detective, guess we may have underestimated you a bit, but it truly doesn't matter."" "
1141111111111,Officer Jeb ,"""Things are in motion that can't be stopped, I recomed that you step away from this while you can."" "
11411111111111,Officer Jeb ,"""Because if you don't then you'll end up like the bodies that surround us. We are always watching Detective."" he walks away from the scene[end]"
1141112,You ,"""That would certainly explain a few different things, so much has been happening to me lately. Mabey the mountain of papaerwork is starting to finally get to me."""
11411121,Officer Jeb ,"""My thoughts exactly Detective, all this work can really wear at the mind. Be sure to take it easy for a bit.[end]"
11412,You ,"""I-I guess you're right, it must've slipped my mind."""
114121,Officer Jeb ,"""Exactly Detective, your welcome to take a look around, but honestly I don't think there is anything much here.""[end]"
2,You ,"""What the hell happened here!"""
21,Officer Jeb ,"""I wish I could tell you, but this is what it looked like when I got here."""
211,Officer Jeb ,"""Though when I was traveling to the location there was a bright light followed shortly after by what sounded like an explosion."" "
